# @herdr/web

React + Vite frontend for `herdr-web`.

Run from this directory:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
npm run lint
npm run test
npm run build
```

The production build is written to `web/dist/` and served by `herdr-web-bridge` through
`scripts/run-bridge.sh`.

Blocked agents stay in the sidebar's Needs attention list until their status clears. To receive
desktop alerts while Herdr Web is open, enable Desktop notifications under Settings → Features;
the browser will ask for permission. Alert sound is a separate setting. Notifications are
deduplicated across tabs on the same origin and open the matching host and pane when clicked.
The app does not receive alerts after every tab or installed-app window is closed.

For the normal one-command development workflow, start the bridge and Vite from the repository root:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:5173`. Vite proxies `/api` and `/ws` to the managed bridge and hot-reloads
frontend edits. See the root README for address and socket overrides.

To manage the two processes separately instead:

```bash
# terminal 1, from the repository root
npm run bridge:build && scripts/run-bridge.sh

# terminal 2, from the repository root
npm run dev:web
```

`scripts/run-bridge.sh` points debug bridge builds at the stable Herdr socket by default instead of
the debug `herdr-dev` socket. Override `HERDR_SOCKET_PATH` when targeting a named or development
session.

The app expects these bridge routes:

- `/api/capabilities`
- `/api/snapshot`
- `/api/command`
- `/api/launcher-presets`
- `/api/launcher-presets/launch`
- `/api/selection`
- `/api/notes` (and `/api/notes/{note_id}/...` actions)
- `/api/agent-pins` (and `/api/agent-pins/{pane_id}/pin|unpin`)
- `/api/agent-activity`
- `/api/uploads`
- `/ws/activity`
- `/ws/events`
- `/ws/ui-events`
- `/ws/terminal`

Launcher execution belongs to the bridge. The frontend selects a preset and placement; it does not
construct Herdr `agent.start` requests. Built-in agents use Herdr's managed-agent flow after the
bridge creates the destination pane, while custom presets retain their exact configured `argv`.

New space uses the active space on the selected bridge as its launch-directory source.
Herdr still controls the directory policy. Its default in `~/.config/herdr/config.toml` is:

```toml
[terminal]
new_cwd = "follow"
```

This inherits the source space's directory as resolved by Herdr (its active tab's focused
pane, or the space's seed directory).
Other Herdr directory policies remain in effect; the browser does not override `cwd`.
When there is no active space, Herdr chooses its default source.
If another client closes the source space before creation, Herdr rejects the request;
refresh/select an existing space and retry. The browser does not silently switch the
launch directory by retrying without a source.
