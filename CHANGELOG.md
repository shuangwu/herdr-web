# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Breaking Changes

### Added

- Add selectable Solarized Dark and Catppuccin themes for the app and terminal, plus system,
  Menlo, and bundled JetBrains Mono font choices in terminal settings.

- Add macOS remote setup scripts with supervised Linux bridges, reconnecting SSH tunnels,
  a local gateway, and a browser page for merging saved bridge profiles.

- Allow configured bridge URLs to include a reverse-proxy path prefix for same-origin multi-bridge
  deployments. [PR #94](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/94), contributed by
  [Will Hampson (@Whamp)](https://github.com/Whamp).

### Changed

- Automatically increment Android `versionCode` and stamp `versionName` in the tagged release
  commit, keeping repeated builds of that release on the same Android version.
  [PR #91](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/91).
- Document APK package, signature, alignment, and update-signer checks, and clarify debug signing.
  [PR #91](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/91) by
  [Will Hampson (@Whamp)](https://github.com/Whamp).

### Fixed

- Send protocol-level pings on idle browser WebSockets and close connections that do not return peer
  traffic within 15 seconds, removing dead transports without claiming to detect frozen JavaScript.
  [PR #93](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/93), contributed by
  [Will Hampson (@Whamp)](https://github.com/Whamp).

### Removed

## [0.6.1] - 2026-09-12

### Added

- Add a non-repeating Enter key at the end of the expanded mobile arrow row, also selectable
  for shortcuts such as Alt+Enter. [PR #89](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/89).

- Add mobile terminal keys with hold-repeat and a shortcut builder for Ctrl, Shift, and Alt
  combinations with special or printable keys. [PR #89](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/89),
  building on [PR #63](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/63) by
  [Will Hampson (@Whamp)](https://github.com/Whamp).

### Changed

- Keep Esc, Tab, C-c, C-d, and 1/2/3 in the mobile quick-key row. The neutral keyboard icon
  expands Backspace, arrows, and navigation keys, with a keyboard-plus shortcut toggle inside.
  [PR #89](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/89).
- Share the same keys between direct input and shortcut building. Show the selected chord with
  Send and Cancel actions; tapping the selected key again clears it while retaining modifiers.
  Sending, cancelling, or collapsing the keyboard exits shortcut mode without changing the
  command draft.
  [PR #89](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/89).

### Fixed

- Preserve terminal or command-field focus when tapping mobile quick keys, shortcut keys,
  or modifier toggles so the soft keyboard can stay open.
  [PR #89](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/89).

- Keep held mobile terminal keys repeating through UI updates, and send conventional
  modified Backspace, Tab, and Escape input without requiring an extended keyboard protocol.
  [PR #89](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/89).

- Start mobile terminal refit retries after the current terminal renderer mounts, so a slow tab
  switch cannot leave the terminal at its initial keyboard-sized height.
  [PR #90](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/90).

## [0.6.0] - 2026-09-07

### Breaking Changes

- Require Herdr v0.9.0 or newer with terminal protocol 22.
  [PR #88](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/88).

### Changed

- Refresh the minimal Herdr compatibility code for v0.9.0 while retaining the existing
  per-terminal ANSI rendering, browser input, and shared-view behavior.
  [PR #88](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/88).

### Fixed

- Use the browser's active space as the source for new-space launch directories,
  respecting Herdr's `terminal.new_cwd` policy instead of another client's focus.
  [PR #88](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/88).
- Require explicit confirmation before closing a primary workspace and its related workspaces.
  [PR #88](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/88).
- Subscribe to live agent activity before establishing the initial status snapshot.
  [PR #88](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/88).

## [0.5.2] - 2026-09-07

### Added

- Add an optional mobile “Focus command input after Send” setting, off by default,
  to refocus the cleared command field for continued typing.
  [PR #85](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/85).

- Added an opt-in desktop command composer under Settings → Terminal for editing multiline input
  before sending it, without changing desktop terminal selection, scrolling, or cursor
  behavior. [PR #82](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/82), contributed by
  [Andreas Ahrens (@AndreasAhrens)](https://github.com/AndreasAhrens).

### Fixed

- Redraw idle Windows terminal selections and scrolling with cursor blinking disabled,
  and apply cursor-blink changes immediately to mounted terminals.
  [PR #87](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/87).

- Add a Terminal setting for cursor blinking and default it off on Windows. When it is
  off, render only for terminal updates and interactions instead of repainting the
  high-DPI canvas continuously, avoiding severe lag in large Windows browser windows.
  [PR #86](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/86).

- Discard late keyboard composition updates for 250 ms after command Send or Stage so
  submitted dictation cannot immediately repopulate the replacement input. Preserve existing
  field replacement and focus behavior; ordinary non-composing typing and paste remain accepted.
  New composition started within this brief window can also be discarded.
  [PR #85](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/85).

- Update locked development dependencies to established security-patched releases for the
  Capacitor, lint, test, and frontend build tools, preserving cross-platform optional packages.
  [PR #85](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/85).

- Focus the enabled desktop command composer on terminal attach and navigation focus requests,
  after closing Settings, and after Send, including Ctrl+Enter and Cmd+Enter. Direct terminal
  clicks retain focus through reconnects and immediately after a default focus request. Desktop
  Stage focuses the terminal to edit or run the staged input; mobile keyboard behavior
  remains unchanged. [PR #82](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/82).

- Keep unsent desktop and mobile command drafts per bridge and pane while navigating, until
  sent, staged, or the pane is confirmed closed. Drafts remain in memory for the current browser
  tab only. [PR #82](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/82).

- Fixed desktop terminal copy shortcuts so copying selected text no longer also sends Ctrl+C to
  the PTY; Ctrl+C without a selection and Ctrl+C on macOS retain their normal interrupt behavior.
  [PR #84](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/84), contributed by
  [Andreas Ahrens (@AndreasAhrens)](https://github.com/AndreasAhrens).

## [0.5.1] - 2026-09-04

### Added

- Added a bundled JetBrainsMono Nerd Font Mono fallback for special terminal and LLM output glyphs
  on devices without an accessible Nerd Font.
  [PR #74](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/74), contributed by
  [Craig P. Motlin (@motlin)](https://github.com/motlin).

### Changed

- Upload conflicts are now atomically de-duplicated by default: re-uploading `image.png` lands as
  `image-1.png` instead of prompting to replace the original, including when uploads race. Turn off
  automatic conflict renaming under Settings → Terminal → Uploads to keep the Replace or Cancel
  prompt. Existing files are replaced only after explicit confirmation.
  [PR #77](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/77), contributed by
  [Trillium Smith (@trillium)](https://github.com/trillium).

## [0.5.0] - 2026-08-21

### Breaking Changes

- The bridge now requires Herdr `v0.8.2` or newer reporting terminal protocol `20`. Herdr
  `v0.8.0` and `v0.8.1` daemons (protocol `19`) are rejected at startup.
  [PR #69](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/69)

### Changed

- Refreshed the vendored Herdr compatibility sources to the `v0.8.2`/protocol `20` baseline.
  The new protocol `20` server message variants (`TerminalBell`, `GraphicsFile`,
  `GraphicsTransmissionRetired`) decode but are ignored by the bridge, adding no new behavior.
  [PR #69](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/69)
- Compress terminal output with gzip when the client and bridge both support it.
  [PR #59](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/59), contributed by
  [Will Hampson (@Whamp)](https://github.com/Whamp).
- Changed the Attention agent sort to break ties within an attention band by the most recent agent
  status change, matching Herdr's Priority agent panel, and kept the existing bridge, Space, and tab
  order as the fallback for agents with no recorded transition.
  [PR #68](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/68), contributed by
  [Craig P. Motlin (@motlin)](https://github.com/motlin).
- Stop blinking the terminal cursor on touch devices so idle terminals do not keep redrawing.
  Desktop cursors still blink.
  [PR #60](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/60), contributed by
  [Will Hampson (@Whamp)](https://github.com/Whamp).

### Fixed

- Join canvas-wrapped HTTP(S) URLs when copying from a mobile terminal.
  [PR #61](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/61), contributed by
  [Will Hampson (@Whamp)](https://github.com/Whamp).

## [0.4.3] - 2026-08-17

### Added

- Added an optional screen-reader text mirror for visible terminal contents, with bounded updates
  and concealed-cell filtering. [PR #64](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/64), based on the
  concept proposed by
  [shuv (@shuv1337)](https://github.com/shuv1337) in
  [PR #37](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/37).

### Fixed

- Improved keyboard focus behavior for dialogs and action menus: modal focus stays contained,
  menus support arrow, Home, and End navigation, Tab exits menus normally, and dismissing an
  overlay restores its opener. [PR #62](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/62), based on work
  proposed by [shuv (@shuv1337)](https://github.com/shuv1337) in
  [PR #37](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/37).

## [0.4.2] - 2026-08-15

### Added

- Added `npm run dev` to supervise the bridge and Vite HMR server together, wait for bridge
  readiness, proxy API and WebSocket traffic, and stop both processes cleanly.
  [PR #57](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/57), based on work proposed by
  [Hopkins (@LosEcher)](https://github.com/LosEcher) in
  [PR #51](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/51).
- Declared the existing Herdr logo as the browser favicon.
  [PR #56](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/56), contributed by
  [Craig P. Motlin (@motlin)](https://github.com/motlin).

### Changed

- Static bridge responses now explicitly revalidate HTML and public files while caching successful
  content-hashed Vite assets as immutable. Error responses are never marked immutable.
  [PR #57](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/57), based on work proposed by
  [Hopkins (@LosEcher)](https://github.com/LosEcher) in
  [PR #51](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/51).

### Fixed

- Fixed CJK and other IME terminal input so preedit stays local, committed text is sent exactly
  once, canceled composition is discarded, and the candidate window and visible preedit stay near
  the terminal cursor. [PR #58](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/58), based on work proposed
  by [Hopkins (@LosEcher)](https://github.com/LosEcher) in
  [PR #51](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/51).
- Fixed icons rendering slightly off-center in square icon buttons (sidebar section header
  actions and the tab bar's new-tab button) by resetting the user-agent button padding, and
  removed the per-icon transform that compensated for it.
  [PR #55](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/55), contributed by
  [Philippe SEGATORI (@tigitz)](https://github.com/tigitz).

## [0.4.1] - 2026-08-05

### Breaking Changes

- Herdr `v0.8.0` or newer with terminal protocol exactly `19` is now required. The bridge rejects
  the previous protocol `17` baseline and other unreviewed protocols instead of attempting a
  backward-compatible wire fallback. [PR #48](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/48)

### Added

- Added a contextual Move Space mode to the Spaces menu. The selected space card becomes draggable,
  retains a cancel control and arrow/Home/End keyboard support, mutes unrelated sidebar actions
  until the move is completed or canceled, and moves worktree groups atomically within their host's
  canonical workspace order. [PR #48](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/48)
- Added persistent expand/collapse controls to grouped Agents, Tabs, and Spaces headers, including
  independent, visually nested host and workspace controls for Host + workspace grouping and a
  bulk expand/collapse control for the current Agents or Tabs list.
  [PR #47](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/47)
- Added a default-off Display setting that combines same-named workspaces across hosts when using
  Workspace grouping, while retaining host context on each agent or pane row.
  [PR #47](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/47)

### Changed

- Refreshed the minimal vendored Herdr compatibility sources to the `v0.8.0`/protocol `19`
  baseline, including the current API schemas, terminal wire definitions, and input model shims.
  [PR #48](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/48)
- Follow Herdr's canonical workspace order when atomic worktree groups are reordered.
  [PR #48](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/48)
- Simplified Workspace grouping in the Agents and Tabs sidebars to show workspace-only group
  headers and move host context into each detail row. Host + workspace grouping keeps its nested
  host and workspace headers. [PR #47](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/47)

### Fixed

- Fixed built-in agent launches against Herdr `v0.8.0` by waiting for a newly created pane's shell
  to become available before starting the managed agent.
  [PR #48](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/48)

## [0.4.0] - 2026-07-30

### Breaking Changes

- Herdr `v0.7.5` or newer with terminal protocol exactly `17` is now required. The bridge rejects
  older protocol `16` daemons and unreviewed newer protocols rather than attempting a
  backward-compatible wire fallback. [PR #45](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/45)
- Removed the obsolete `custom_status` field from bridge snapshots and activity events; agent
  presentation now uses Herdr's `state_labels`, title, display-agent, and status fields.
  [PR #45](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/45)
- Changed the default ungrouped Tabs and Spaces sidebar presentation to compact rows with inline
  host, Space, and tab context instead of contextual headers. Agent panes in Tabs also use the
  Agents row presentation and agent-aware ordering by default. Choose a grouping mode to restore
  contextual headers, or disable Agent features in Tabs to restore generic pane rows and the
  original tab order. [PR #41](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/41)

### Added

- Added a default-on client-local Sync navigation setting. Browser tabs and windows with sync off
  can view different panes through the same bridge without publishing or following shared pane
  selection or changing Herdr's focused tab through ordinary navigation.
  [PR #42](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/42)
- Added default-on Agent features in Tabs, including consistent Agents row metadata and pin
  placement, agent-aware sorting, and pinned-only and active-only filters. Non-agent tabs remain
  visible at the bottom of agent-aware sorts; disabling the setting restores generic pane rows.
  [PR #41](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/41)
- Added multi-host Spaces controls: Spaces can be shown as a flat list with host context or grouped
  under host headers, and the default-on Multi-host Space selection setting can be disabled to limit
  Space-scoped Agents, Tabs, and Notes to one globally selected Space. All scope remains unchanged.
  [PR #41](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/41)

### Changed

- Refreshed the minimal vendored Herdr compatibility sources to the `v0.7.5`/protocol `17` baseline,
  including the current API schemas and terminal wire definitions.
  [PR #45](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/45)
- Updated launching for Herdr `v0.7.5`: built-in agents use the managed `agent.start` flow after the
  destination pane is created. The bridge waits for interactive readiness and rolls back its new
  tab or pane after rejection, early process exit, or timeout. Custom launcher presets continue to
  execute their exact configured `argv`. [PR #45](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/45)
- Store the Sync navigation setting browser-wide while keeping sync-off pane selections only in
  memory. The app no longer creates per-tab navigation storage records.
  [PR #43](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/43)
- Simplified agent-row metadata by removing generic status text already communicated by the status
  indicator and badge, while retaining bridge-defined state labels.
  [PR #41](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/41)

### Fixed

- Cleared and remounted the mobile terminal command field after Send or Stage so stale native input
  cannot prefix the next command. [PR #44](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/44), with an
  earlier implementation contributed by
  [Alexander Makarov (@AlexanderMakarov)](https://github.com/AlexanderMakarov) in
  [PR #38](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/38).
- Fixed client-local navigation synchronization across reloads, reconnects, lagging snapshots, and
  rapid multi-client selection races. Sync-off split navigation now stays local, and independent
  clients no longer rewrite shared navigation persistence. After a bridge restart, the focused
  Herdr pane now seeds shared navigation so synced clients immediately converge.
  [PR #43](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/43)

## [0.3.3] - 2026-07-19

### Added

- Added Grok and OpenCode agent icons in the Agents sidebar and create-menu launch choices.
  [PR #36](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/36)
- Added built-in launcher presets for Grok and OpenCode (`builtin:grok`, `builtin:opencode`).
  [PR #36](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/36)
- Added optional `builtins` allowlist/order in `launcher-presets.json` so the create menu can show a
  subset of built-ins without PATH probing. Omitting `builtins` keeps the full default set; `[]`
  hides all built-ins (custom presets still appear). Short names (`shell`) and full ids
  (`builtin:shell`) are accepted; unknown entries warn and are ignored.
  [PR #36](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/36)

### Fixed

- Kept the first selected character anchored during mobile endpoint dragging, aligned the loupe caret
  with the selected row, and centered a hollow drag handle over the anchored character.
  [PR #35](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/35)

## [0.3.2] - 2026-07-07

### Breaking Changes

- Users must upgrade Herdr to `v0.7.2` or newer before upgrading herdr-web. The bridge now requires
  a Herdr daemon with protocol `16` because browser snapshots use Herdr's native
  `session.snapshot` API.
  [PR #32](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/32)

### Added

- Added an Agents-view active-status filter that shows only agents currently
  marked working, blocked, or done, with grouped views hiding empty groups after
  filtering. [PR #31](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/31)

### Changed

- Refreshed the vendored Herdr compatibility baseline to `v0.7.2`, including protocol `16`, native
  session snapshots, layout/scroll event schema drift, and terminal observe/control wire messages.
  [PR #32](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/32)
- Changed `/api/snapshot` to use one native Herdr `session.snapshot` request instead of separate
  workspace, tab, pane, and per-tab layout requests.
  [PR #32](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/32)

## [0.3.1] - 2026-07-03

### Added

- Added bridge-owned configurable launcher presets for the create menu, including argv-based custom
  agent commands, optional Herdr agent hints, and horizontally scrollable launch choices.
  [PR #30](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/30)
- Documented macOS x86_64 desktop tarball support alongside Linux x86_64 and macOS ARM64 release
  artifacts.
  [PR #30](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/30)
- Refreshed the vendored Herdr compatibility baseline to `v0.7.1` for launcher preset agent hints.
  [PR #30](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/30)

### Fixed

- Fixed mobile sidebar space selection so tapping a space updates the scoped Tabs list instead of
  snapping back to tabs from the previously selected pane.
  [PR #29](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/29)
- Fixed a bridge reattach race where a client reconnecting right after the last viewer left a
  terminal could be rejected by the daemon with `already has an attached client` and shown a
  permanent `Attached elsewhere` error; the bridge now shuts detached attach connections down and
  reattaches only after the pending detach has been delivered.
  [PR #26](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/26)
- Stopped detached terminal attach connections from leaking a blocked reader thread and an open
  socket on both the bridge and daemon sides after every pane switch.
  [PR #26](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/26)
- Serialized concurrent first attaches per terminal in the bridge and made the web client briefly
  retry `already has an attached client` rejections, so multiple viewers reconnecting at once
  (for example after a bridge restart) no longer strand a terminal on a permanent
  `Attached elsewhere` error. The bridge also now logs daemon-initiated attach connection closes,
  which were previously recorded nowhere.
  [PR #26](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/26)

## [0.3.0] - 2026-07-02

### Added

- Added an `Add note` action to pane and agent sidebar context menus, opening a quick-create
  dialog with a focused title and optional body that attaches the new note to the target pane.
  [PR #24](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/24)
- Added Mobile settings for an expanding terminal command input and Enter-as-newline
  editing, allowing long prompts to wrap and remain viewable while preserving send-on-Enter
  by default. [PR #21](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/21)
- Added bridge-tracked agent status transition activity with an Agents view sort option for
  `Last status change`, using semantic status changes rather than terminal output activity.
  [PR #23](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/23)
- Added server-side agent pins with pinned-first agent ordering, a pinned-only sidebar toggle, and
  a selected-pane header toggle plus a small pinned indicator on pinned agent rows.
  [PR #22](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/22)
- Added bridge-owned pane notes with a sidebar Notes view, desktop/mobile notes editor, pane
  attachment recovery states, and per-bridge note synchronization. Notes are exposed through the
  same bridge request policy as terminal controls, so allowed bridge clients can read and mutate
  saved note content. [PR #20](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/20)
- Added a Notes feature toggle plus persisted desktop notes panel sizing, notes list collapse
  state, notes panel open state, pane note tabs, and a dedicated Other notes list.
  [PR #20](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/20)
- Added a Markdown preview mode for notes that remembers Edit/Preview preference locally and keeps
  the Markdown renderer lazy-loaded until preview is used. [PR #20](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/20)

### Changed

- Unified the `session_key` reported by `/api/agent-activity` with the notes and agent-pins
  endpoints (`session:default` and FNV-1a socket hashes instead of a divergent local format).
  [PR #25](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/25)
- Extended the pinned-only sidebar toggle to the Tabs view so pinned panes can be found outside the
  Agents view. [PR #23](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/23)
- Notes created from the notes panel now open in Edit mode with the title selected, so the default
  title can be replaced immediately. [PR #24](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/24)

### Fixed

- Made the bridge close and cleanly reattach terminal sockets that fall behind fast output instead
  of silently dropping frames and corrupting the rendered stream.
  [PR #25](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/25)
- Moved the bridge's remaining blocking daemon round-trips (snapshot, selection, agent activity,
  rename-label lookups) off async worker threads, so a stalled daemon no longer freezes unrelated
  requests and terminal websockets.
  [PR #25](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/25)
- Bounded the bridge's per-terminal input queue so a client sending faster than the pty drains no
  longer grows bridge memory without limit.
  [PR #25](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/25)
- Fixed terminal session races where a client connecting while the previous one disconnected could
  be handed an already-detached session, and where the daemon handshake blocked all other terminal
  clients.
  [PR #25](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/25)
- Stopped the bridge from silently tightening permissions on a pre-existing operator-supplied
  `--upload-dir`; only directories the bridge creates itself are set to 0700.
  [PR #25](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/25)
- Applied the standard 120-byte label validation to `pane.rename` requests, matching every other
  rename/create command.
  [PR #25](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/25)
- Stopped a cancelled terminal mount from leaking an orphaned renderer and duplicated canvas when
  the pane changes while the terminal module is still loading.
  [PR #25](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/25)
- Made single-cell touch selections highlight correctly instead of silently storing a wrong
  scrollback row.
  [PR #25](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/25)
- Preserved combining characters and multi-codepoint emoji when copying terminal text via touch
  selection.
  [PR #25](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/25)
- Kept the selected note open while no pane is selected, so notes no longer deselect mid-edit when
  a bridge disconnects, has zero panes, or a notes refresh lands.
  [PR #25](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/25)
- Made Escape in settings number fields discard the typed value instead of committing it, and stop
  it from closing the whole settings dialog; out-of-range numbers now snap back to the clamped
  value in the field.
  [PR #25](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/25)
- Reordered Android hardware-back handling so open menus and dialogs close before the notes panel
  underneath them.
  [PR #25](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/25)
- Made Escape cancel the rename dialog from any focused control, not just the text input.
  [PR #25](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/25)
- Extended long-press text-selection prevention to the stage header pane title.
  [PR #25](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/25)
- Restored the intended drop shadow and muted URL color on the terminal selection sheet, which
  referenced undefined CSS variables.
  [PR #25](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/25)
- Validated agent-pins responses at the fetch boundary so a malformed bridge response degrades
  gracefully instead of crashing the sidebar render.
  [PR #25](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/25)
- Prevented sidebar row labels and terminal tab labels from being text-selected during long-press
  context-menu gestures. [PR #24](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/24)
- Fixed notes editor selection and autosave edge cases so switching to panes without notes clears
  the editor, deleting the selected note no longer shows a deleted note, and stale local save
  refreshes do not appear as external note changes. Also fixed mobile delete-dialog back handling
  and unresolved note recovery actions in the notes panel. [PR #20](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/20)
- On mobile, kept the note editor's terminal action available for the current pane and made it
  close the full-screen notes surface. [PR #20](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/20)
- Changed mobile notes back navigation so back closes the notes surface from the editor, while a
  separate header button shows the notes list. [PR #20](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/20)
- Kept the new-tab button pinned at the right edge of the top tab bar while the tab list scrolls.
  [PR #20](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/20)
- Improved terminal reconnect/resume handling so Android foregrounding and quick terminal switches
  keep the renderer stable, avoid stale tab flashes, and suppress transient connecting overlays.

  [PR #16](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/16)

  order across selected-host and all-host views. [PR #18](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/18)

  to other trusted bridge origins without relaxing the default Content Security Policy.
  [PR #17](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/17)
- Added a Host + workspace grouping option for agent lists.
  [PR #17](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/17)

## [0.1.2] - 2026-06-18

### Added

- Added a bridge-owned agent activity stream so pane status, title, display agent, and custom
  status updates reach connected browsers without waiting for a full snapshot refresh; concepts
  derived from the @roy-levi-amazon fork. [PR #11](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/11)
- Added Display settings for top/bottom app padding and mobile terminal controls size.
  [PR #13](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/13)

  connections. [PR #12](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/12)

### Changed

- Coalesced fast terminal output bursts in the bridge before forwarding them to browser clients,
  with a per-client Terminal output batching setting for tuning frame churn during rapid TUI
  redraws; concepts derived from the @roy-levi-amazon fork.
  [PR #14](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/14)
- Reworked Settings into Bridge, Terminal, and Mobile areas, with horizontal area tabs on narrow
  screens. [PR #12](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/12)
- Improved browser startup by lazy-loading the terminal renderer with retry after load failures,
  adding installable mobile web app metadata and raster icons, and compressing static
  bridge-served web assets; concepts derived from the @roy-levi-amazon fork.
  [PR #10](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/10)
